# Vector
his C program implements basic operations on a dynamic array (vector). It provides functionalities such as initialization, accessing elements, checking emptiness, adding and removing elements, retrieving size and capacity, inserting elements at specific positions, and printing all elements.

Features
Initialization: Initialize the vector with a specified initial capacity.
Access Element: Access an element at a specific position in the vector.
Empty Check: Check if the vector is empty.
Push Back: Add an element to the end of the vector.
Pop Back: Remove the last element from the vector.
Size and Capacity: Retrieve the current size and capacity of the vector.
Insert: Insert an element at a specified position in the vector.
Print Elements: Print all elements of the vector.
How to Use
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/AmalyaPogosyan/Vector.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd Vector
Compile the C program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):

bash
Copy code
gcc -o vector_operations vector_operations.c
Run the compiled program:

bash
Copy code
./vector_operations
Follow the on-screen instructions to perform various vector operations:

Initialize the vector with a specified capacity.
Access elements at specific positions.
Check if the vector is empty.
Add and remove elements from the vector.
Retrieve the size and capacity of the vector.
Insert elements at specific positions.
Print all elements of the vector.
Exit the program by choosing the appropriate option from the menu.

Example
Here is a sample session demonstrating the usage of this vector operations program:

markdown
Copy code
Enter the activity's number.
1. Initialization
2. One of the elements
3. Is empty array?
4. Push element from back
5. Pop element from back
6. Get the size of array
7. Get capacity of array
8. Insert element at fixed index
9. Print all elements
10. Exit
1
Enter the capacity: 5
Initialization successfully done.

Enter the activity's number.
